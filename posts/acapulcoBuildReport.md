This is a clone of Earthquaker Devices infamous Acapulco Gold distortion which is modeled to sound a lot like the power amp distortion of Sunn's Model T. Of course it doesn't quite get there because you can only get so far with opamps compared to actual tubes but it's close enough and sounds great!

Normally, an Acapulco Gold would cost as much as $129 new but this build only cost me $40(incl. shipping)! But how did I build it?

I used a kit from the German supplier [musikding.de](https://musikding.de) that should allow even beginner solderers/pedal builders to produce a working stompbox.
