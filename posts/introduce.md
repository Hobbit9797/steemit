Hey fellow Steemians!

Let me introduce myself: My name is Niklas, I'm from Germany and I'm a software developer in his early 20s by day and a lazy procrastinator(also in his early 20s) &#128517; by night.

I just recently found out about Steemit through a YouTube video by @sempervideo. [Link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJCgkAvT5FM). The video is in German though, so I bet most of you aren't going to find any value in it.&#128521;

I'd love to spend as much of my free time with you guys as possible, to enjoy your content and to post quality content on my own as well. For my own content I will focus on a topic that has become one of my favourite hobbies during the last few months.

Guitar effects pedals!

That's right, those little prohibitively expensive boxes of aluminium that make your guitar sound good. Especially fascinating for me is the DIY aspect of the pedal community. Turns out you can build these things for yourself for a fraction of the cost of a brand name pedal.

My plan is to post anything from build reports including demos of pedals I've built and will be building(expect one of these posts a month) as well as resources that are going to be handy if you decide to build a pedal on your own like beginner guides, shopping recommendations, circuit layouts and more!

If that sounds like something you could enjoy, give me a follow and join me on this journey. &#128513;

You will be able to find me in diy, guitar and electronics for the most part!
