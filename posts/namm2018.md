NAMM 2018 is starting soon and many companies already came out with their big releases.

In addition to tons of general guitar stuff there have been quite a few highlights in the guitar pedal world that I'd like to tell you about.

While EQD are mainly releasing second versions of a few current pedals, their big highlight is undoubtedly the Westwood Translucent Drive Manipulator.

The Westwood promises to be a transparent gain pedal that delivers anything from a nearly-clean boost to a bluesy, but never harsh, overdrive.
It also comes with an active EQ that allows you to really mess with your treble and bass.

If you want to check out the Westwood in action, I would recommend for you to watch(and listen to) [Reverb's demo on YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f7OX4SG4mM).

## TC Electronicâ€™s Sonic Specialists

TC Electronic are bringing us a new range of affordable tone sculptors they are calling the Sonic Specialists. Each of the four new pedals aims to bring a very specific sound to life.

First, we've got the Gauss Tape Echo which is a delay pedal that is supposed to sound a lot like the actual tape echo machines of the 70's. 

The Vibrachlone Rotary which they are dubbing the King of the Whirl is a rotary speaker emulator that promises to get you a lot closer to that Hendrix tone.

The Drip Spring Reverb can be described by two words. Surf rock. But in good hands it might even be able to sound like something not Dick Dale related.

Lastly, there's the Fluorescence Shimmer Reverb. It trys to be the perfect reverb solution for genres like ambiant guitar and shoegaze.

All four pedals are supposed to arrive sometime in Q1 and their prices aren't known yet.

## Alexander Pedals Quadrant Audio Mirror

The Quadrant Audio Mirror ticks all of the boxes for a modern digital delay.

* Four different delay styles(analog, digital, lo-fi and magnetic)
* Four presets you are able to cycle through
* Tap-tempo
* Midi and expression pedal compatibility 
* And more!

It comes at a fair price of 199$ MSRP and you can buy it and listen to some demos at [alexanderpedals.com](https://www.alexanderpedals.com/shop/quadrant).

I don't know about you but I am excited for whatever more NAMM has in store for us!
